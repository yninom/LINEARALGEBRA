# Computational Algebra Lineal

In this repository you will find the five homework assignments in the Computational Linear Algebra module. The following is a brief description of the files

1. MNIST Dataset:

MNIST.ipynb: First approach to the MNIST dataset with 60k training images, the dimensionality reduction using MDS could not be performed because of its size.

DIGITS.ipynb: PCA, MDS and tSNE for a reduced MNIST dataset found in sklearn.

2. Flowers Dataset

PCA, MDS and tSNE for an image dataset of 16 flower species.

3. Image Compression

flowerscompression.ipynb, gato.jpg, gato_compress_0.01.jpg.

Compression function using SVD, gato.jpg is the test image and then I performed it with 100 images of Magnolias species from the flower dataset.

4. Audio Compression

audiocompression.ipynb, comedy.mp3 and new_comedy.mp3.

Compression function using SVD, not very successful.

5. Movies Recommender

Movies recommender function using SVD.
